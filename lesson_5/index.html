						The group members chose the name Trivium, which means "three ways" or "three roads" in Latin, because they "liked the way in which this name shows their impartiality to different styles, and sums up their musical aesthetics." Matt started playing talent-seeking shows while still in high school, where he sang Metallica's No Leaf Clover. Brad Luter drew attention to Matt and asked him to try singing in his group. He came to Travis Smith and they played Metallica's For Whom The Bell Tolls together. Then Matt entered the group. After a couple of cases before the court, Brad Luter left the group and Gifi became the first vocalist. Gifi also performed Self Esteem by The Offspring at the high school talent show. Gifi was also a member of the Orlando black metal band Mindscar, before moving to Trivium. In 2002, Gifi received the Best Metal Guitarist Award at the Orlando Metal Awards. Subsequently, in early 2003, Trivium gathered to record their first high-quality demo disc. After the premiere of the demo, the German label Lifeforce signed a contract with Trivium to record their debut studio album Ember To Inferno.

						After replacing the instruments that each of the band members played, Brent Young decided to play bass, while Corey Beaulieu became the second guitarist. In 2004, Paolo Gregoletto joined as the band's bassist in time for a tour with Machine Head. After good sales of their debut album, Trivium signed with Roadrunner Records and began writing songs for their next album, Ascendancy.

						Work on the band's second album, Ascendancy, was completed in July 2004. It was recorded at Audiohammer and Morrisound studios in Orlando, Florida, and was released on March 15, 2005 via Roadrunner Records. The group made a big tour in support of the album. They performed with Machine Head, Iced Earth, Killswitch Engage and Fear Factory. "What's great about touring is that every night is a party," says Gifi, "not because everyone drinks alcohol, but because people understand well. The energy from the fans is impressive. " Their concert tour also included the US Roadrage 2005 tour, bringing together bands such as The Agony Scene, Still Remains and 3 Inches of Blood. The band also had 13 appearances at 2005 Roadrage in the UK in the summer. Trivium also performed on the main stage of Download Festival 2005.
					</p>
					<p>
						During July and August 2005, Trivium appeared in Ozzfest, playing the second stage side by side with bands like As I Lay Dying, Arch Enemy, Killswitch Engage and Rob Zombie. After Ozzfest, the band rushed back to the UK to tour with All That Remains and It Dies Today. They later played in Japan with Arch Enemy and then travelled to the United States and Canada for a major support tour with Children Of Bodom and Amon Amarth. In early 2006, Trivium were the main support for the Swedish band In Flames on a North American tour, along with DevilDriver and Zao.
					</p>
					<p>
						In 2006, Trivium recorded a cover of "Master Of Puppets" for Kerrang! Remastered is a tribute album to Master Of Puppets by Metallica. Machine Head, Mendeed, Bullet For My Valentine, Fightstar, Chimaira, Mastodont, and Funeral For A Friend also appear on this album. This was released exclusively in Kerrang! magazine, which was released on April 5, 2006.

					<p>
						Trivium began recording a new album in April 2006, shortly after they had 2006 headlined The Crusade III: Ascend Above the Ashes with God Forbid. The band played on the main stage at Download Festival in 2006, alongside Korn and Metallica.
						The Crusade was a change in their musical style. Most of the lyrics were sung, unlike the previous two albums where most of the vocals were shouted. In an interview with Blabbermouth, Gifi says, "If anyone wonders why the scream is gone, it's because four of us have never been in groups that scream and, we don't like any of the current groups that scream, so we asked ourselves why we do it. The only reason I started screaming in the first turn is because I didn't sing well and wanted to be the band's first vocalist. At this time, I wanted to be the best singer, because that's what we wanted to hear, so we stopped screaming and did a lot of vocal training and vocal work. I think everyone will be really happy with it and the ones that aren't can go listen to any of those cheap bands from which everyone does the same. I mean the quote "evolve or disappear" and we evolved.
					</p>
					<p>
						The album was placed at # 172 in the UK rock charts and had a debut in the UK album charts at # 7. The album was on the US Billboard charts at # 25. The album saw the use of 7-string guitars on a number of songs, notably the tracks This World Can't Tear Us Apart, And Sadness Will Sear, Becoming The Dragon, Contemplt Breeds Contamination and the album title track. The band's style has been described as a return to the classic thrash metal sound of bands such as Metallica, Testament, and Megadeth. The album received generally positive reviews from critics. Metal Hammer voted the album in the # 9 best albums of 2006, as well as for Trivium itself as the best "live" team in the Metal Hammer's Golden Gods Awards.
